* search for broken links in output files
  namely, the string
  " -- broken link?]]"
* ? think about leading # symbols, and others
** motivation
   In .org files, lines that start with # in Github will not render.
   If generating Markdown, they will be different,
   but present similar issues.
** what to research
   What happens to lines that start with #? *? -? +?
   If there's leading space before them?
* ? include backlinks at (top?) of each file
* probably obsolete
** Should it produce .md, or .org?
*** org would be more natural
    Since Github has canned ways of showing org,
    Keeping it .org would mean skipping a lot of translation steps.
** If producing .md, find a canned org-to-md conversion routine
   If it exists, it's probably easier to modify that
   than to start from scratch.
** Should I create a new ID, one that definitely works,
   for each linked headline?
** research Github URL formats
