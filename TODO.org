* Should it produce .md, or .org?
** org would be more natural
   Since Github has canned ways of showing org,
   keeping it as org would mean skipping a lot of translation steps.
* If producing .md, find a canned org-to-md conversion routine
  If it exists, it's probably easier to modify that
  than to start from scratch.
* research links to headings
** What is the format?
** Can it be done in a .org file on Github?
** Should I create a new ID, one that definitely works,
   for each linked heading?
* research Github URL formats
* worry about leading # symbols, and others
** motivation
   In .org files, lines that start with # in Github will not render.
   If generating Markdown, they will be different,
   but present similar issues.
** what to research
   What happens to lines that start with #? *? -? +?
   If there's leading space before them?
